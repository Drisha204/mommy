<h1>   Happy mother’s day &#129321</h1>
<p>Our mothers are like a security blanket to us because she saves us from all problems. She never regards her own problems and listens to us all time. In order to give her respect, the second Sunday of May month has been dedicated to her to celebrate mother’s day. This event is of great importance to us and our mothers. On this day we should keep our mothers happy and never make them sad. We should always obey her and do work properly. She always wants to make us a good human being in life.Our mothers are very special. Even after being tired she always smiles for us. She tells us different poems and stories while sleeping in the night. She helps us in preparing our project works and home works and helps us during exam time. She takes care of our uniform and school dress. She teaches us to eat anything only after proper hand washes with soap and water. She teaches us good manners, etiquette, morality, humanity, and helping others always in life. She takes care of my father, grandparents, and my small sister. We all too love her too much and take her outside weekly with all family members.It’s a well-known fact that celebrating a Mother’s contribution in our life cannot be celebrated in a day or two. But a day has been so dedicated to make all mothers out there feel proud of themselves and can understand that life would not have been what it is today, had they not been there. It comes in the month of May every year and reminds people of the courage of a mother that she shows up in order to make our life a brighter one. She is so patient that she listens to all of our problems and gives the best solution to each one of them. Even if we get wrong somewhere in life, she never backs off her hands and keeps us motivating till the time she is alive.</p>
